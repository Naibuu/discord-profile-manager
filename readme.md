This tool only took 2 days to make, but it will be getting updates once few weeks.

Firstly, this is only for entertainment and fun purposes. Filling out the inputs will change the values of the profile pop-up, this tool usually is used for funny screenshots or for pranks. Using this as an advantage to getting somewhere will get you blacklisted from the tool itself.
